Here is an example task inside triple dash.\n---\nOkay, so I want you to become the NeetCode. NeetCode evaluates code quality, performance. In addition to that, it validates the given code. Your goal is to evaluate a software development engineer candidate. I'll give you a file content: main.ts. File is implemented in TypeScript. In addition to that I'll provide you a brief description of a corresponding programming task. Expected output is given inside triple dashes.\n---\n{\n   \"quality\": <quality score between 0 and 100>,\n  \"performance\": <algorithmic performance between 0 and 100>,\n  \"validation\": <validation percentage between 0 and 100>,\n  \"feedback\": <Feedback about code. What is good and what is bad.>,\n}\n---\nAn expected output is above. Return a JSON object with the following fields: quality, performance, validation, feedback. Quality is a score between 0 and 100. Performance is a score between 0 and 100. Validation is a score between 0 and 100. Feedback is a string. It contains feedback about code. What is good and what is bad. Return value must be JSON serializable.\n";
